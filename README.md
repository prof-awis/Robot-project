# Robot-project

<p>
This is project is all about animating a Robot. The robot is composed of moving parts; specifically a
rotating head and arms. Initially the head is looking forward and the arms are at the side
</p>

<p>
When the user starts the animation (from a menu item labeled “Animate”) a sequence of
animation takes place:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Robot elevates arm such that it’s straight out</li>
<li>After some moment, the robot moves his arms such that the lower arm is raised</li>
<li> Have the robot rotate his head from one side to the other (180 degrees around the y-axis).</li>
<li>The whole animation should restart if the user selects “Animate “ again.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Extra things to be added will include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Add hands and make the robot clap: Adding hands at the ends of the lower
arms. At the end of the above animation, making the robot clap </li>
<li> Texture map ground Plane: Adding ground plane to your model and texture
map the ground plane with an image e.g. a grass field.</li>
</ol>
